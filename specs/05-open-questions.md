## Decided (Q&A on 2026-10-13 and 2026-10-23)
| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | Country: **Peru (SUNAT)** |
| D2 | Channel: **official WhatsApp Cloud API**, with Telegram as an optional fallback |
| D3 | Users: several allowlisted people, **< 200 invoices per month** |
| D4 | ~~Ask in chat~~ → **revised 2026-10-23:** the flow is picked **automatically from the buyer RUC** (owner → A, work → B). A menu appears only when nothing matches (BR-R03) |
| D5 | Flow A: buyer is the owner's company RUC (20…); **SUNAT is the fallback** (owner has SOL) |
| D6 | Flow B: buyer is the employer's RUC; **no SUNAT access** → portals, then email, then manual |
| D7 | Hosting: **1 GB RAM VPS**, highly optimized (see constitution P2) |
| D8 | Build style: **code first + n8n**. Revised by the 1 GB constraint: n8n is an optional sink (Q1) |
| D9 | Flow B email: **all three trigger modes** (per invoice, on command, scheduled), configurable and combinable |
| D10 | Flow B Excel: **existing template, update specific cells** |
| D11 | When every fallback fails → **MANUAL_REQUIRED** and the user is told what is missing |
| D12 | Unknown, DNI or empty buyer → **ask then, and only then**, with buttons Mi empresa / Trabajo / Cancelar |
| D13 | Missing capability → **GitHub issue + draft PR + red CI** (spec 06 §3) |
| D14 | Unknown store portal → the bot **asks the user for the link** (once per issuer) and puts it into the draft PR |
| D15 | Admin alerts also go to **WhatsApp** (in addition to GitHub's own notifications) |
| D16 | GitHub repo is **private**. The real config (RUCs, phone numbers) lives only on the VPS, never in git (Q12) |
| D17 | Bot GitHub credential: **fine-grained personal access token**, this repo only (Issues, PRs, Contents); expiry warning 14 days before (Q13) |
| D18 | Admin alerts go **only to the owner's number** (Q14) |
| D19 | Gap PRs are completed by the **owner**; tagging `@claude` on the issue is optional help (Q15) |
| D20 | The VPS **pulls `main` every 10 min** and hot-reloads the config, so merged fixes go live and stuck invoices resume automatically (Q16) |
| D21 | `confirm_mode: auto`: no tap needed when everything reads cleanly; Editar/Cancelar stay available (Q17) |

## Open (needed before or during Phase 0)
Until they are answered, work proceeds with the default in the last column. Q2–Q5 still need real input (accounts, recipients, template file, inbox) before E11 and S9.5.
| # | Question | Why it matters | Default if unanswered |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | OK with n8n as an *optional* add-on (off on the 1 GB host), with the core in Python? Or do you prefer a 2 GB host (~US$4–6/mo) so n8n runs alongside? | RAM budget | Core in Python, n8n off |
| Q2 | Microsoft accounts: is your personal account outlook.com/hotmail (MSA)? Does your work tenant allow consenting to a third-party app? Should the bot write to your **personal** OneDrive and share that folder with your work account, or should the work account share a folder with your personal one? | Determines auth and folder location | Personal MSA OneDrive, folder shared with work |
| Q3 | Email for flow B: which provider sends it (Outlook personal through Graph, or Gmail), and who receives it (to and cc)? | Mailer config | Graph from the personal account |
| Q4 | Can you share the **Excel template** (cells to fill, sheet name, .xlsx or .xlsm, formulas, and whether a batch means one file per invoice or one file with many)? | Cell mapping; batch format | One file per invoice |
| Q5 | Which email do you give restaurants and stores for the electronic invoice? Can the bot read that inbox (Gmail or Outlook)? | The `email_inbox` fetcher is the strongest free fallback, especially for flow B | Gmail, read-only scope |
| Q6 | Google Sheet columns and Drive folder structure for flow A: keep the proposed defaults, or do you have an existing sheet? | Sheets mapping | Proposed defaults |
| Q7 | Required docs per flow: should flow B still deliver if only the PDF *or* only the XML is found? | Delivery rule | Both are required for B, XML for A |
| Q8 | Do you also need **boletas** (B-series, buyer DNI) or only **facturas** (F-series)? | Boletas often lack a buyer RUC; SOL won't list them | Facturas first, boletas best-effort |
| Q9 | Any currency other than PEN (USD invoices)? | Parsing and Sheets formatting | PEN, USD read from XML when present |
| Q10 | Comfortable creating a **secondary SOL user** with query-only permissions for the bot? | Security of the `sunat_sol` fetcher | Yes |
| Q11 | Do you already have a VPS provider or a domain for Cloudflare Tunnel? | Deploy | Any 1 GB VPS, plus a free `trycloudflare` URL for dev |
