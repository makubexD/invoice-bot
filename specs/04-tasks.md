# 04 · Backlog: epics and user stories

**Format:** each story is small or medium, independently testable, and traced to requirement IDs (spec 02) and business rules (spec 06).

| Size | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **S** (small) | ≤ 1 day, one module, a few tests |
| **M** (medium) | 2–3 days, touches 2–3 modules or an external API |

Anything bigger gets split before work starts.

**Story template:**
- *As …, I want …, so that …*
- **AC** (acceptance criteria): each one is a test.
- **Reqs** and **Deps**.

**Definition of done (every story):**
- Every AC has a test.
- `ruff`, `mypy` and `pytest` are green, and so is `check_config.py`.
- Requirement IDs and rule IDs are cited in the PR.
- No secrets in code or logs.
- Memory impact is noted if the story touches extraction or the browser.

## Milestones
| Milestone | Epics | Demo |
|---|---|---|
| **M0 · De-risk** | E0 | Spike reports answer the risky unknowns |
| **M1 · Read & route** | E1–E5 | Send a photo; the bot replies with the parsed summary and the **auto-detected** flow. Golden-set accuracy report |
| **M2 · Flow A + gaps** | E6–E9 | Photo → row in Sheets plus files in Drive. An unknown store → chat explanation, a GitHub issue, a draft PR, red CI and an admin alert |
| **M3 · Portals** | E10 | A seeded portal downloads XML/PDF automatically (captcha included). A merged gap PR auto-resumes stuck invoices |
| **M4 · Flow B** | E11 | 3 work invoices → `/enviar` → one email with PDFs, XMLs and the filled Excel |
| **M5 · Ops** | E12 | Memory budget enforced in CI, backups, runbook |

## E1 · Foundation
**S1.1 · Project scaffold** · S · Reqs R-9.5
- *As the developer, I want a scaffolded repo with uv, ruff, mypy, pytest, pre-commit and a Dockerfile, so that every later story starts from green.*
- **AC:**
  - `GET /health` returns 200.
  - The Docker image builds.
  - Idle RSS is < 80 MB.
  - Pre-commit runs ruff and mypy.

**S1.2 · Typed config + `check_config.py`** · M · Reqs R-9.6, R-11.6 · Deps S1.1
- *As the owner, I want my YAML validated at startup and in CI, so that a typo never reaches production.*
- **AC:**
  - Pydantic models for every config section.
  - Unknown keys are rejected.
  - `{owner.ruc}` placeholders are resolved.
  - `check_config.py` exits ≠ 0 on an invalid config **or** on any portal with `status: todo|broken`, and lists them.

**S1.3 · SQLite store + migrations** · S · Reqs R-9.4 · Deps S1.1
- *As the system, I want a WAL SQLite schema with versioned migrations, so that state survives restarts.*
- **AC:**
  - All the spec 03 §3 tables exist.
  - Migrations are idempotent.
  - The pragmas are applied.

**S1.4 · Job queue with lease and backoff** · M · Reqs R-9.4 · Deps S1.3
- *As the system, I want durable jobs with leases and exponential backoff, so that a crash never loses work.*
- **AC:**
  - A killed worker's job is re-leased after `lease_until`.
  - After 5 failures the job goes to `FAILED`.
  - `HEAVY` semaphore = 1.

**S1.5 · Outbox** · S · Reqs R-1.8, R-11.5 · Deps S1.4
- *As the system, I want outgoing WhatsApp and GitHub calls persisted before sending, so that they are retry-safe.*
- **AC:**
  - The outbox row is written in the same transaction as the state change.
  - Its sender retries with backoff.
  - It supports both the `whatsapp` and `github` channels.

**S1.6 · CI workflow** · S · Reqs R-11.6 · Deps S1.2
- *As the owner, I want CI on every push and PR, so that a red build signals that something needs fixing.*
- **AC:** `ci.yml` runs lint, mypy, tests and `check_config.py`, and a deliberately added `status: todo` makes it fail.

## E2 · WhatsApp channel
**S2.1 · Webhook verify + signature** · S · Reqs R-1.3
- **AC:**
  - The GET handshake works.
  - A bad `X-Hub-Signature-256` gets 401.
  - A valid one gets 200 in < 1 s.

**S2.2 · Idempotent intake, allowlist, ack** · M · Reqs R-1.1, R-1.2, R-1.8 · Deps S2.1, S1.5
- *As a sender, I want an instant "recibido" when I send a photo, so that I know it's being processed.*
- **AC:**
  - A duplicate `message.id` is ignored.
  - A non-allowlisted sender is ignored silently.
  - The ack is enqueued within 5 s.
  - The job is created.

**S2.3 · Media download** · S · Reqs R-1.4

- **AC:**
  - The payload builders for text, reply buttons (≤ 3) and lists are unit-tested against the Meta schema.
  - Button IDs encode `invoice_id:action`.

**S2.5 · Interactive reply handling** · S · Reqs R-3.2, R-3.5 · Deps S2.4
- **AC:**
  - Button and list replies map to `(invoice_id, action)`.
  - A stale button (invoice already past `DELIVERING`) gets a polite "ya está en proceso".

**S2.6 · Fake channel for tests** · S · Deps S2.4
- *As the developer, I want an in-memory channel, so that end-to-end conversation tests run without Meta.*
- **AC:** Conversation scripts can assert the exact messages sent, by rule ID.

## E3 · Extraction (no AI)
| ID | Story | Size | Key AC | Reqs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S3.1 | Validators: RUC mod-11, serie regex, date bounds, total ≈ base + IGV | S | Table-driven tests, including edge cases (check digits 10 → 0 and 11 → 1) | R-2.4 |

| S3.5 | OCR preprocessing + Tesseract subprocess with timeout | M | Warp/deskew/threshold pipeline; 30 s timeout → BR-E01 | R-2.3 |
| S3.6 | OCR rule parser (`parsing_rules.yaml`) + printed-URL capture | M | Golden OCR field accuracy ≥ 80%; `printed_urls` captured | R-2.3, R-2.10 |
| S3.7 | Per-field source/confidence + `ok`/`needs_review` | S | Uncertain fields are flagged in the model | R-2.6 |
| S3.8 | Golden-set accuracy report (CI artifact) | S | Per-field accuracy table; CI fails below the R-2.9 thresholds | R-2.9 |

## E4 · Routing and conversation (no flow menu)
**S4.1 · Routing rules engine** · S · Reqs R-3.1 · Rules BR-R01/02
- *As the owner, I want the flow chosen from the buyer RUC, so that I never have to pick it by hand.*
- **AC:**
  - Ordered rules; the first match wins.
  - Rules are compiled to frozensets at load time.
  - Owner RUC → `personal_google`; work RUC → `work_microsoft`.
  - A new rule in YAML routes to a new flow with no code change (test with a fake flow C).

**S4.2 · Summary + auto-continue** · M · Reqs R-3.4, R-9.3 · Deps S4.1, S2.4
- *As a sender, I want one summary showing what was read and where it's going, and processing that just continues, so that the UX is smooth.*
- **AC:**
  - With `confirm_mode: auto` and all fields `ok`, the pipeline moves to `VALIDATING` without waiting.
  - The summary includes `🏢 Mi empresa → Google` or `💼 Trabajo → Microsoft` and [Editar] [Cancelar].
  - The happy path uses ≤ 3 messages.
  - `confirm_mode: always` waits for a tap.

**S4.3 · Unknown buyer → ask (only case with a menu)** · S · Rules BR-R03 · Reqs R-3.2
- **AC:**

**S4.8 · Timeouts → PENDING_USER** · S · Reqs R-3.7
- **AC:**
  - An unanswered question parks the invoice after 24 h.
  - `/pendientes` lists it and lets you resume it.

**S4.9 · Basic commands** · M · Reqs R-10
- **AC:**
  - `/ayuda`, `/estado <id>` (shows state **and the rule ID and message that explain it**), `/pendientes`, `/cancelar <id>` and `/reprocesar <id>` all work.

## E5 · Business-rule catalog
**S5.1 · Catalog + parity test** · S · Reqs R-11.1
- *As the owner, I want every message to come from one catalog keyed by rule ID, so that wording is consistent and nothing is silent.*
- **AC:**
  - `rules/catalog.py` maps BR-* → (state, message template).
  - A test parses `specs/06-business-rules.md` and fails on any ID that is missing on either side.

**S5.2 · Rule ID on every transition** · S · Reqs R-11.1 · Deps S5.1
- **AC:**
  - `invoices.rule_id` is set on every non-happy transition.
  - Rendering a message with a missing placeholder fails the test suite.

## E6 · SUNAT validation
| ID | Story | Size | Key AC | Reqs / rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S6.1 | OAuth client_credentials + token cache in `kv` | S | Refreshes 60 s before expiry; works across restarts | R-4.3 |
| S6.2 | `validarcomprobante` + BR-V01..V04 handling | M | Each estadoCp, RUC estado and outage case is mapped to its rule and message; the V01 re-check is scheduled | R-4.1, R-4.2 |

## E7 · Fetcher framework
| ID | Story | Size | Key AC | Reqs / rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S7.1 | Chain of responsibility + `FetchResult` + `fetch_attempts` stats | M | Per-flow order from config; stops at the first valid XML; every attempt is recorded with its reason | R-5.1, R-5.7 |
| S7.2 | `qr_url` fetcher | S | Follows the QR or printed URL; httpx streaming; size limits | R-5.2 |
| S7.3 | UBL 2.1 parser + XML-matches-invoice check | M | Wrong XML → BR-F06; the XML values become authoritative, and discrepancies are reported | R-5.6, R-2.7 |
| S7.4 | `manual` terminal step (BR-F07 message, built from the attempt reasons) | S | One `•` line per fetcher, using the BR-F texts (F01 for flow B) | R-5.5 |
| S7.5 | Accept user-sent PDF/XML for `MANUAL_REQUIRED` | S | A quoted or most-recent open invoice is matched; the XML is validated; delivery resumes | R-1.5 |

## E8 · Gaps, GitHub and admin alerts
**S8.1 · Gap registry + dedupe** · S · Reqs R-11.2
- *As the owner, I want 10 invoices from the same unknown store to create one gap, not ten, so that alerts stay useful.*
- **AC:**
  - `raise_gap()` upserts by fingerprint in the same transaction.
  - `invoice_gaps` links the invoices.
  - The fetcher chain keeps running.

**S8.2 · Teach the portal link via chat** · M · Rules BR-F02 · Reqs R-11.4 · Deps S8.1
- *As a sender, I want the bot to ask me for the store's download link when it doesn't know it, so that the fix is mostly done by the time someone looks at it.*
- **AC:**
  - The question is asked once per issuer, not per invoice.
  - The answer is validated (https, public host, ≤ 300 characters, no credentials).
  - "no sé" is accepted.
  - `/portal <ruc> <url>` does the same thing.
  - `printed_urls` are offered as a suggestion.

**S8.3 · GitHub issue (idempotent)** · M · Reqs R-11.5, R-11.10 · Deps S1.5, S8.1
- **AC:**
  - Created through the outbox from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/gap.md`, with labels `gap` and `gap:<kind>`.
  - A hidden `<!-- gap:fp -->` marker prevents duplicates even after a DB loss.
  - Only privacy-safe fields are included (snapshot test).
  - Respects the daily budget.

**S8.4 · Draft PR with portal stub** · M · Reqs R-11.5 · Deps S8.3
- *As the owner, I want a ready-to-finish PR, so that fixing a missing portal means filling in selectors, not starting from zero.*
- **AC:**
  - Deterministic branch `gap/<slug>`.
  - YAML stub appended with comments preserved and `status: todo`, plus the taught or printed URL.
  - Draft PR with "Closes #n" and a checklist.
  - Never touches the default branch.
  - Re-running doesn't duplicate anything.

**S8.5 · Admin WhatsApp alert + digest** · M · Reqs R-11.8, R-11.11
- **AC:**
  - One alert per new fingerprint, with the issue and PR links.
  - Re-alerts are rate-limited to `realert_days`.
  - Digest kinds go into one daily message.
  - The `gap_alert` utility template is used outside the 24 h window.
  - The alert is still sent if GitHub is down.

**S8.6 · `gap-watch` scheduled workflow** · S · Reqs R-11.7
- **AC:** The workflow fails while a `gap` issue is older than `gap_sla_days`, and passes otherwise.

**S8.7 · Config pull + hot reload + auto-resume** · M · Reqs R-11.9 · Deps S1.2, S8.1
- *As a sender, I want my stuck invoice to finish by itself once the portal is added, so that I don't resend anything.*
- **AC:**
  - A systemd timer pulls with `--ff-only`.
  - `SIGHUP` reloads the config, which is validated **before** it is swapped in (a bad config keeps the old one and alerts the admin).
  - `reevaluate()` re-enqueues the invoices linked to fixed gaps and notifies their senders.

**S8.8 · PORTAL_BROKEN detection** · S · Rules BR-F03 · Deps S7.1, S8.4
- **AC:**
  - `broken_after` consecutive *technical* failures (not "not found") raise the gap.
  - The PR flips the entry to `status: broken`.

**S8.9 · Admin commands + token expiry** · S · Rules BR-D05 · Reqs R-10
- **AC:**
  - `/gaps` lists open gaps with their links.
  - `/gap ignorar <id>` silences one.
